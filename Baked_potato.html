        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>

          <li>
            Wash the russet potatoes thoroughly and pat them dry. Prick the
            potatoes all over with a fork to allow steam to escape during
            baking.
          </li>

          <li>
            Rub the potatoes with a little olive oil, and then season them
            generously with salt and pepper. This will give the potato skin a
            delicious flavor.
          </li>

          <li>
            Place the seasoned potatoes directly on the oven rack or on a baking
            sheet lined with aluminum foil. Bake for about 45-60 minutes, or
            until the potatoes are tender and the skins are crispy.
          </li>

          <li>
            While the potatoes are baking, prepare the creamy cheese sauce. In a
            saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium-low heat. Add the minced
            garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.
          </li>

          <li>
            Reduce the heat to low, and gradually whisk in the cheddar cheese
            and Parmesan cheese until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Be
            patient, and make sure not to overheat the sauce, as it can become
            grainy. Add nutmeg, salt, and pepper to taste. Keep the sauce warm
            on low heat.
          </li>

          <li>
            Once the baked potatoes are done, remove them from the oven and let
            them cool slightly for a few minutes. Slice each potato open
            lengthwise, fluffing the insides with a fork.
          </li>

          <li>
            Pour the creamy cheese sauce generously over each potato, allowing
            it to seep into the nooks and crannies of the fluffy potato flesh.
          </li>

          <li>
            Garnish with chopped fresh chives or parsley for a burst of color
            and flavor.
          </li>

          <li>
            Serve your Creamy Cheesy Baked Potatoes as a delightful side dish or
            enjoy them as a satisfying main course.

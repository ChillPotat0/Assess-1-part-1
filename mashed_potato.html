        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Place the peeled and cubed potatoes in a large pot of salted water.
            Bring to a boil and cook for about 15-20 minutes or until the
            potatoes are fork-tender.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the potatoes are cooking, heat the milk, minced garlic, and
            butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Heat until the butter is
            melted and the mixture is warm.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drain the cooked potatoes and return them to the pot. Mash them with
            a potato masher or a hand mixer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gradually pour the warm milk and garlic mixture into the mashed
            potatoes, stirring until smooth and creamy. Add more milk if needed
            to reach your desired consistency.
          </li>
          <li>
            Season with salt and pepper to taste and stir in the chopped fresh
            chives.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve hot, garnished with extra chives and a pat of butter if
            desired.
